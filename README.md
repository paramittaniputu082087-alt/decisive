# Decisive

*Decisive* is a decision intelligence stack designed to support structured, accountable, and repeatable decision-making in complex organisations.

It provides a clear framework to model decisions, evaluate options, record assumptions, and trace outcomes—reducing ambiguity and improving governance across teams.

---

## What Problem It Solves

Organisations often make critical decisions without:
- clear structure,
- documented reasoning,
- or measurable accountability.

Decisive addresses this by turning decisions into explicit, auditable systems rather than informal discussions or ad-hoc approvals.

---

## Core Principles

- *Structured Decisions* — every decision follows a defined model  
- *Traceability* — assumptions, inputs, and outcomes are recorded  
- *Accountability* — decisions have owners, rationale, and review paths  
- *Repeatability* — successful decision patterns can be reused  

---

## Use Cases

- Strategic and operational decision support  
- Risk and compliance review processes  
- Product and technology governance  
- Policy, investment, and resource allocation decisions  

---

## Status

This repository represents an *early-stage conceptual and architectural implementation* of the Decisive system.

It is intended for:
- design validation,
- discussion with partners,
- and exploration with potential enterprise adopters.

## Roadmap (High Level)

- Decision model formalisation  
- Decision lifecycle tracking  
- Scoring and evaluation logic  
- Integration with organisational workflows
